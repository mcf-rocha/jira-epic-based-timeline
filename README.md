# jira-epic-based-timeline

From a given agile board, it gets all cards in the most recent sprints and then group cards per sprint in order to display a timeline like this

|.      |.              |
|Epic A |.              |
|.       |Issue key A.1 |
|.       |Issue key A.2 |
|.       |Issue key A.3 |
|Epic B |.              |
|.       |Issue key B.1 |
|.       |Issue key B.2 |
|.       |Issue key B.3 |
|.       |Issue key B.4 |
|.       |Issue key B.5 |
|Epic C |.              |
|.       |Issue key C.1 |
|.       |Issue key C.2 |


You'll be able to:
- display the above table in the standard output in a txt format; or
- export data to a CSV file that you can either import to Google Spreadsheet in order to create a pivot table in the format above.
